					<b>Your Second Phone</b> started as a little experminent back in 2010. It originally existed as a means to call phones right from the browser, but has since evolved into a multi-tool of ad hoc communications.
				</p>
				<p>
					With the advent of WebRTC, <b>Your Second Phone</b> has become a turnkey video chat client, where anybody can simply load a session without having an account or handing over personal infomation. <b>Your Second Phone</b> has never and will never require an account to use.
